## Objectives
- Learn what offensive security means  
- Understand attack stages (Recon, Exploitation, Privilege Escalation, Post-Exploitation)  
- Know common tools (nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, etc.)

## Notes
- Offensive security = acting like a hacker to test defenses  
- Steps of an attack:
  1. Recon → collect info  
  2. Enumeration → deeper scan  
  3. Exploitation → break in  
  4. Privilege escalation → become admin  
  5. Post-exploitation → move inside system  
- Real-world use = penetration testers & red teamers
